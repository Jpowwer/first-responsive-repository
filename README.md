# first-responsive-repository
Hello I'm Joshua, this is one of my first Github repositories. If you see this it's because I'm
learning Git & Github. I still have a long path of learning ahead and am eager to continue learning
and developing my knowledge and skill. 

I've completed Juno college's Web Development & JavaScript courses and hope to pursue their Bootcamp. 



My favourite colour is all of the colours. 
Thank you for reading!
